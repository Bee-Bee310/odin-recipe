    <h2>Worth the Effort</h2>
    <p>Stir-Fried pork is one of the most balanced meals. A great source of protein, easy carbs, and vegetables for fiber, this dish can easily be batched and saves money immensely in the long run though a little more effort than most meals as well</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork Shoulder</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp Salt</li>
        <li>1/4 Bottle Kikkomen Kikko Stir-Fry Sauce</li>
        <li>1 Cup of Rice</li>
        <li>2 Cups of Water</li>
        <li>Ponzu or Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Small Slice of Butter</li>
        <li><em><strong>OPTIONAL:</strong> Vegetables (Carrot, Peppers, Onion, Mushroom, Shoots)</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take Pork Shoulder and make thin slices of pork using a pairing knife for easier cuts. You will only need approximately a 1/4 cup of meat. Bag the rest and freeze for future use</li>
        <li>Take your 1/4 cup of pork and place in a ziplock bag with a 1/4 of the Kikkomen Kikko Stiry-Fry Sauce and 1/8 tsp of salt. Move pork around sauce to cover as much as possible. Place in fridge when thoroughly mixed ad coated</li>
        <li>Grab your rice and wash it in a sift-like colander or by hand until water comes out mostly clear. Add to rice cooker if available or to a pan that can hold two cups of water and has a lid </li>
        <li><strong>IF USING POT:</strong> Put on a low heat and check occasionally by stirring to prevent sticking of rice to pan. Rice will be finished when the rice is fluffy and you can see no water. Remove from heat immediately once it reaches this stage</li>
        <li>Once rice is finished, grab stir fried pork from your fridge and add it to a pan/wok with a sliver of butter</li>
        <li>Brown pork as it should cook all the way through being thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Remove pork and place in a a small bowl for later</li>
        <li><em><strong>OPTIONAL:</strong> If adding veggies, now is your time to sear them with a little butter as well to make sure they'll be ready for the end product</em></li>
        <li>Add rice to pan with a thin slice of butter as well. Add Soy/Ponzu Sauce to your rice and stir over heat letting the rice lightly fry</li>
        <li>Add pork <em>(and optional vegetables)</em> in as you are finishing to let it reheat slightly before removing from the stove and serving</li>
    </ol>

<p><em>Note: Woks are easiest to use when cooking this meal as they heat much more evenly and faster than normal pans. Thr rounded corners also help with stirring as well</em></p>
